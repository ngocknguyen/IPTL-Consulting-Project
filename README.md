# IPTL-Consulting-Project
International Professional Tennis League (IPTL) is a start-up company dedicated to making tennis the most profitable and popular sport internationally. IPTL strives to disrupt the current tennis industry by introducing a numeric game format and marketing platform where fans can interact and engage with the sport in real-time. Rather than being focused on an individual competitive sport, IPTL fosters a community.
I volunteered as a consulting analyst at SJSU x MISA to help the client understand their overall positioning in the larger tennis industry and consult in building a marketing plan.
We conducted analyses to:
• Performed a market research analysis on WTA and ATP datasets from 2019-2021 to reveal top professional tennis players globally, tennis trends, upset chances in Grand Slams, and the correlation between ages and chosen average match time. 
• Identify partnership opportunities for client via research of market of local tennis clubs and organizations
• Build a marketing plan to raise awareness and further develop content strategy
